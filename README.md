*Graphast* is a framework tool that allows users to compose a number of user-generated/populated network models, data importing/exporting services as well as query services, in order to quickly build applications on time-dependent road networks. The main goal is to allow users to  prototype solutions to different types of problems on time-dependent road networks using nearest neighbor queries or optimal sequenced routes and a "plug-and-play" approach with a visual interface. Users can choose to combine facilities provided by the *Graphast* framework via a public API and/or build their own facilities, e.g., a new query processing algorithm, and incorporate those into *Graphast* for others to use them as well.
